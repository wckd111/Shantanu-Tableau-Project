A Tableau dashboard designed to analyze workforce attrition, surface risk patterns, and help organisations make data-driven HR decisions.  
This project demonstrates skills in data cleaning, KPI design, dashboard building, and analytical storytelling.

## 📊 Project Overview

This dashboard explores key HR metrics to answer questions like:

- Which departments are driving most of the attrition?
- Which age groups and genders are at highest risk of leaving?
- How does job satisfaction correlate with turnover?
- Which education fields and roles show the most instability?
- What does overall workforce health look like today?

The goal is to turn raw HR data into a clear, executive-ready view of workforce risk.
